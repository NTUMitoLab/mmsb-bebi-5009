# Rules for programming homeworks

## Format for Coding assignments

We currently accept code in

- Python (`*.py`)
- Julia (`*.jl`)
- MATLAB (`*.m`)
- Jupyter Notbooks (`*.ipynb`)

Please also tell us what environment you are running (e.g. Python/Julia/MATLAB version, package(s)/toolbox). Providing dependency info is encouraged (e.g. `requirements.txt` for pip / `environment.yml` for conda / `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` for Julia). **Reproducibility matters**.

## Uploading your assignments

- Please upload your assignments to the assignment section in NTU COOL (<https://cool.ntu.edu.tw/>).
- Please upload other parts (text, math expressions, figures) along with the code if needed. NTU COOL supports uploading multiple files at once.
- Please make sure the files and the links are valid. Broken ones will receive *no credit*.
- Email TA if you have technical problems (no access, cannot upload, etc.)
- Please **do not** upload your HWs to CEIBA since it's being deprecated.

## Credits (Scores)

You will receive full credit if the output is correct and your code reproduces it.

- Wrong numbers / figures due to slight errors in the code = *partial credit*
- Spaghetti code that TA/Prof cannot reproduce = *no credit* in the programming part.
- No code = *no credit* in the programming part.
- Late HW = *no credit*. (However, if you have difficulties finishing the HW on time, please contact TA/Prof. *before* the due date.)

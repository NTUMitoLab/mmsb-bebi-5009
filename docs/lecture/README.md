# Class lectures

Chapter 1-4 describes mathematical modelling in molecular systems biology.

- Basic notions of mathematical modelling.
- Dynamic mathematical models of chemical reaction networks. (ODE models)
- Biochemical kinetics of enzyme-catalysed reactions and cooperative binding.
- Model reductions.
- Analyzing differential equation models: phase plane, stability, bifurcations, sensitivity analysis.

Chapter 5 and beyond are applications in specific biological domain(s).

- Stoichiometric modelling for large-scale metabolic networks. e.g. [COBRA](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/)
- Signal transduction pathways.
- Gene regulatory networks.
- Electrophysiology and action potentials in exitable cells.
